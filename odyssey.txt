These lines contain the traditional epic “opening formula” that includes the invocationof the inspiring Muse, the statement of the theme, the identification of the hero (in this caseOdysseus), and a glance at the significance of the story.HOMER/The Odysse y, Book One27305_273-611_Homer 2/Aesop  7/10/00  1:25 PM  Page 273
children and fools, they killed and feasted onthe cattle of Lord Hêlios,2the Sun,and he who moves all day through heaventook from their eyes the dawn of their return.Of these adventures, Muse, daughter of Zeus,tell us in our time, lift the great song again.Begin when all the rest who left behind themheadlong death in battle or at seahad long ago returned, while he alone still hungered20for home and wife. Her ladyship Kalypsoclung to him in her sea-hollowed caves—a nymph, immortal and most beautiful,who craved him for her own.And when long years and seasonswheeling brought around that point of timeordained for him to make his passage homeward,trials and dangers, even so, attended himeven in Ithaka,3near those he loved.Yet all the gods had pitied Lord Odysseus,all but Poseidon,4raging cold and rough30against the brave king till he came ashoreat last on his own land.But now that godhad gone far off among the sunburnt races,most remote of men, at earth’s two verges,in sunset lands and lands of the rising sun,to be regaled by smoke of thighbones burning,haunches of rams and bulls, a hundred fold.He lingered delighted at the banquet side.In the bright hall of Zeus upon Olymposthe other gods were all at home, and Zeus,40the father of gods and men, made conversation.For he had meditated on Aigísthos,5deadby the hand of Agamémnon’s son, Orestês,and spoke his thought aloud before them all:“My word, how mortals take the gods to task!All their aff lictions come from us, we hear.2The offense against Hêlios is described in Book XII.3Odysseus’ island homeland, in the Ionian Sea off western Greece (sometimes the spellingis Ithaca).4God of the ocean and brother of the chief of the gods who dwelled on Mount Olympos(Olympus), Zeus.5While  the  Greek  commander  Agamémnon  was  away  fighting  against  Troy,  Aigísthos(Aegisthus) entered into an adulterous union with Klytaimnéstra (Clytaemnestra), Agamémnon’swife; they murdered Agamémnon upon his return. The murder was later avenged by Orestês,son  of  Agamémnon  and  Klytaimnéstra,  as  is  related  in  Aeschylus’  trilogy  of  plays  known  asthe Oresteia.274The Ancient World05_273-611_Homer 2/Aesop  7/10/00  1:25 PM  Page 274
And what of their own failings? Greed and follydouble the suffering in the lot of man.See how Aigísthos, for his double portion,stole Agamémnon’s wife and killed the soldier50on his homecoming day. And yet Aigísthosknew that his own doom lay in this. We godshad warned him, sent down Hermês Argeiphontês,6our most observant courier, to say:‘Don’t kill the man, don’t touch his wife,or face a reckoning with Orestêsthe day he comes of age and wants his patrimony.’Friendly advice—but would Aigísthos take it?Now he has paid the reckoning in full.”The grey-eyed goddess Athena replied to Zeus:60“O Majesty, O Father of us all,that man is in the dust indeed, and justly.So perish all who do what he had done.But my own heart is broken for Odysseus,the master mind of war, so long a castawayupon an island in the running sea;a wooded island, in the sea’s middle,and there’s a goddess in the place, the daughterof one whose baleful mind knows all the deepsof the blue sea—Atlas,7who holds the columns70that bear from land the great thrust of the sky.His daughter will not let Odysseus go,poor mournful man; she keeps on coaxing himwith her beguiling talk, to turn his mindfrom Ithaka. But such desire is in himmerely to see the hearthsmoke leaping upwardfrom his own island, that he longs to die.Are you not moved by this, Lord of Olympos?Had you no pleasure from Odysseus’ offeringsbeside the Argive8ships, on Troy’s wide seaboard?80O Zeus, what do you hold against him now?”To this the summoner of cloud replied:“My child, what strange remarks you let escape you.Could I forget that kingly man, Odysseus?There is no mortal half so wise; no mortalgave so much to the lords of open sky.Only the god who laps the land in water,6God of messengers and messenger of the gods; he was also associated sometimes with thewind. “Argeiphontês” connotes brightness or the ability to clear the sky of clouds.7In myth, Atlas is the titanic being who supports the sky. Here he is described as father ofthe nymph Kalypso, who is holding Odysseus prisoner on her island, Og ́ygia.8The collective name for the Greek forces who fought under Agamémnon against Troy.HOMER/The Odysse y, Book One27505_273-611_Homer 2/Aesop  7/10/00  1:25 PM  Page 275
Poseidon, bears the fighter an old grudgesince he poked out the eye of Polyphêmos,brawniest of the Kyklopês.9Who bore90that giant lout? Thoösa, daughter of Phorkys,an offshore sea lord: for this nymph had lainwith Lord Poseidon in her hollow caves.Naturally, the god, after the blinding—mind you, he does not kill the man;he only buffets him away from home.But come now, we are all at leisure here,let us take up this matter of his return,that he may sail. Poseidon must relentfor being quarrelsome will get him nowhere,100one god, f louting the will of all the gods.”The grey-eyed goddess Athena answered him:“O Majesty, O Father of us all,if it now please the blissful godsthat wise Odysseus reach his home again,let the Wayfinder, Hermês, cross the seato the island of Og ́ygia; let him tellour fixed intent to the nymph with pretty braids,and let the steadfast man depart for home.For my part, I shall visit Ithaka110to put more courage in the son, and rouse himto call an assembly of the islanders,Akhaian10gentlemen with f lowing hair.He must warn off that wolf pack of the suitorswho prey upon his f locks and dusky cattle.I’ll send him to the mainland then, to Spartaby the sand beach of Pylos;11let him findnews of his dear father where he mayand win his own renown about the world.”She bent to tie her beautiful sandals on,120ambrosial, golden, that carry her over wateror over endless land on the wings of the wind,and took the great haft of her spear in hand—that bronzeshod spear this child of Power can useto break in wrath long battle lines of fighters.Flashing down from Olympos’ height she wentto stand in Ithaka, before the Manor,9The encounter with these one-eyed giants (also spelled Polyphemusand Cyclops) is describedin Book IX.10In  a  general  sense,  “Greek”;  more  especially,  descriptive  of  men  living  in  a  region  notfar from Ithaka.11A city and region of southern Greece ruled by Nestor, an aged king and counselor.276The Ancient World05_273-611_Homer 2/Aesop  7/10/00  1:25 PM  Page 276
just at the doorsill of the court. She seemeda family friend, the Taphian captain, Mentês,waiting, with a light hand on her spear.130Before her eyes she found the lusty suitorscasting dice inside the gate, at easeon hides of oxen—oxen they had killed.Their own retainers made a busy sightwith houseboys, mixing bowls of water and wine,or sopping water up in sponges, wipingtables to be placed about in hall,or butchering whole carcasses for roasting.Long before anyone else, the prince Telémakhosnow caught sight of Athena—for he, too,140was sitting there, unhappy among the suitors,a boy, daydreaming. What if his great fathercame from the unknown world and drove these menlike dead leaves through the place, recoveringhonor and lordship in his own domains?Then he who dreamed in the crowd gazed out at Athena.Straight to the door he came, irked with himselfto think a visitor had been kept there waiting,and took her right hand, grasping with his lefther tall bronze-bladed spear. Then he said warmly:150“Greetings, stranger! Welcome to our feast.There will be time to tell your errand later.”He led the way, and Pallas Athena followedinto the lofty hall. The boy reached upand thrust her spear high in a polished rackagainst a pillar, where tough spear on spearof the old soldier, his father, stood in order.Then, shaking out a splendid coverlet,he seated her on a throne with footrest—allfinely carved—and drew his painted armchair160near her, at a distance from the rest.To be amid the din, the suitors’ riot,would ruin his guest’s appetite, he thought,and he wished privacy to ask for newsabout his father, gone for years.A maidbrought them a silver finger bowl and filled itout of a beautiful spouting golden jug,then drew a polished table to their side.The larder mistress with her tray came byand served them generously. A carver lifted170cuts of each roast meat to put on trenchers12before the two. He gave them cups of gold,12Plates.HOMER/The Odysse y, Book One27705_273-611_Homer 2/Aesop  7/10/00  1:25 PM  Page 277
and these the steward as he went his roundsfilled and filled again.Now came the suitors,young bloods trooping in to their own seatson thrones or easy chairs. Attendants pouredwater over their fingers, while the maidspiled baskets full of brown loaves near at hand,and houseboys brimmed the bowls with wine.Now they laid hands upon the ready feast180and thought of nothing more. Not till desirefor food and drink had left them were they mindfulof dance and song, that are the grace of feasting.A herald gave a shapely cithern harpto Phêmios,13whom they compelled to sing—and what a storm he plucked upon the stringsfor prelude! High and clear the song arose.Telémakhos now spoke to grey-eyed Athena,his head bent close, so no one else might hear:“Dear guest, will this offend you, if I speak?190It is easy for these men to like these things,harping and song; they have an easy life,scot free, eating the livestock of another—a man whose bones are rotting somewhere now,white in the rain on dark earth where they lie,or tumbling in the groundswell of the sea.If he returned, if these men ever saw him,faster legs they’d pray for, to a man,and not more wealth in handsome robes or gold.But he is lost; he came to grief and perished,200and there’s no help for us in someone’s hopinghe still may come; that sun has long gone down.But tell me now, and put it for me clearly—who are you? Where do you come from? Where’s your homeand family? What kind of ship is yours,and what course brought you here? Who are your sailors?I don’t suppose you walked here on the sea.Another thing—this too I ought to know—is Ithaka new to you, or were you evera guest here in the old days? Far and near210friends knew this house; for he whose home it washad much acquaintance in the world.”To thisthe grey-eyed goddess answered:13The house bard, or minstrel.278The Ancient World05_273-611_Homer 2/Aesop  7/10/00  1:25 PM  Page 278
“As you ask,I can account most clearly for myself.Mentês I’m called, son of the veteranAnkhíalos; I rule seafaring Taphos.I came by ship, with a ship’s company,sailing the winedark14sea for ports of callon alien shores—to Témesê, for copper,bringing bright bars of iron in exchange.220My ship is moored on a wild strip of coastin Reithron Bight, under the wooded mountain.Years back, my family and yours were friends,as Lord Laërtês15knows; ask when you see him.I hear the old man comes to town no longer,stays up country, ailing, with only oneold woman to prepare his meat and drinkwhen pain and stiffness take him in the legsfrom working on his terraced plot, his vineyard.As for my sailing here—230the tale was that your father had come home,therefore I came. I see the gods delay him.But never in this world is Odysseus dead—only detained somewhere on the wide sea,upon some island, with wild islanders;savages, they must be, to hold him captive.Well, I will forecast for you, as the godsput the strong feeling in me—I see it all,and I’m no prophet, no adept in bird-signs.He will not, now, be long away from Ithaka,240his father’s dear land; though he be in chainshe’ll scheme a way to come; he can do anything.
